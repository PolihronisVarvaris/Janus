📛 App Name Origin

The name Janus is inspired by the Roman god of transitions, beginnings, and duality — symbolizing the evolution of eSports from a fringe activity into a globally recognized career. Just as Janus looks to both the past and the future, our app reflects both the roots and the potential of eSports culture.
